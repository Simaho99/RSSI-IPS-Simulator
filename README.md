This is a simulator program
This program intends to create a simulator for RSSI based indoor positioning systems.
Currently the UHF tags are used and the the model tag to tag interference is used to calculate the position.
The RSSI values read are 
    Previous values recorded by the reader before the new tags/ tracked tags were introduced
    The current values which contains the interference level
The IPS  uses this differece together with mathematical approaches to achieve the the objective
